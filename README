Emulation of free fall detection system based on I2C accelerometer. Done as Embevity hire process assignment.

Requirements:
CMake (3.10 or later) and GCC (any recent version should do). Other compilers might work as well but they haven't been tested.
Tested on Linux (Lubuntu 24.04 LTS).
Program uses IPC message queues so it may have issues building and/or running on Windows.

How to build:
In this file's directory, issue two commands:
cmake .
cmake --build .

Unit tests:
Free fall detection module has its own test suite. It's built alongside other components.
To run tests: execute freefall_ut binary.

How to run:
1. Run the I2C accelerometer emulator: imu_emu
2. Run the detection app: accel_app

Parameters:
accel_app has two optional parameters:
-t - detection threshold, as floating-point value in G units; default: 0.1
-n - minimum number of samples to announce fall condition; default: 5 , range 2 to 64

example: ./accel_app -t 0.4 -n 21

There is also built-in help available (./accel_app -h).
